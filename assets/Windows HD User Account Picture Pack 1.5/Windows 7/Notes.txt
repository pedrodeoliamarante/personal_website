Whereas XP and Vista's user account pictures just cropped and edited background colors, it gets more complex in 7. Some range from simply adding extra saturation to adding various new elements to the image. These HD versions here are closer to the originals, although I have included a handful of edited versions. 

- usertile13 has two versions: one with the original white vinyl center label, and one with it edited to light red like in 7. 
- usertile14 has two versions: one with the original white background and one with the light green background present in 7. 
- usertile20 is lower res than the others due to it being based on a very small part of the image.
- usertile22's background is white instead of very light turquoise because that's what the original image used.
- usertile25 does not have the reflection at the top edited out.
- usertile28 features the guitar label, which was blacked out in 7. 
- usertile30 features a part of the robot that was removed in the 7 version. It is also lower res than the others due to the robot only being a small part of the original image.
- usertile31 and 36 were bought and cropped from their robertharding uploads.
- usertile33 was a pain to remake as Microsoft rotated the image. In the end, it may not be as close as I hoped, but it will do. There is a white mark in the bottom right corner to stay close to the way Microsoft did it (if you look closely enough it's even in the original).
- usertile37 lacks the sky and grass present in 7, because Microsoft added that themselves. 
- usertile44 features three differences from the 7 version: no moon present (it was further away in the original), a small light on the lighthouse is still present and the tiny orange glow is not present as Microsoft added that themselves. 
- Some of the others present here may have less/more saturation than they do in 7.
- The following are not present due to them being taken down from Getty Images: usertile17, 18, 24, 40 and 43.
- The following are not present due to them being made specifically for 7: guest, user, usertile12, 19, 29, and 35.
