<h1>About</h1>
<p>This is a pack of many Windows user account pictures at high resolutions, rather than 48x48 or 128x128! User account pictures from Windows XP, Vista and 7 are included, and a few other stock photos that were taken by Windows photographers. It doesn't have them all, but it still has quite a lot considering their rarity. Note that some of the background colors are different, as Microsoft sometimes altered them from the original images.<br><br>If you aren't aware, Microsoft licensed most of their user account pictures from stock photo sites such as Corbis and Getty Images. I have used a certain downloader tool to retrieve many of these at higher resolutions, and in some cases I even got some directly from old royalty free stock photo CDs. As stock photo sites sometimes take photos down, not all of them are present in this pack, such as palm tree or skateboarder, but I have been trying my best to find them. Also, if you're going to submit any of your finds to this pack, please be aware that I do not accept upscaled user account pictures, as I feel they have less value than the original images. You can always try contacting the original photographers for full res versions, although be prepared to spend a bit of money.<br><br>If you are unsure about anything, read the notes in each folder. These clarify reasons why user account pictures may either look different from expected or why some may be missing.</p>
