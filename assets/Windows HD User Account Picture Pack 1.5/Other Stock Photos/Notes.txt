I have included a selection of photos by the same photographers/artists I feel could work well as user account pictures.- The Alternate Drips folder feature other water drop shots by Don Farrall. The higher res ones come from PhotoDisc CD Elements 2, while a handful were taken from Getty Images. As there are many of these, I have only included a small selection. - Below Shot of Boy on Skateboard is an alternate shot of the skateboarder user account picture. Oddly that is still available while the other one is not. Sadly it's the closest we'll get.- Computer Art Image of Floating Red Umbrella, like airplane, was also made by Clark Dunbar.- The first Gerbera Daisy Close-Up, along with Pink dahlia (Dahlia sp.), close-Up, were taken by Arthur S. Aubry. His Gerbera Daisy Close-Up is literally just XP's red flower recolored to pink. - Ryan McVay, the photographer of usertile27 from Windows 7, also has an image titled Gerbera Daisy Close-Up present here.- Mouse in a Cat's Eyes is an alternate shot of cat from Windows XP. - Rollercoaster track, low angle view is another shot of the same rollercoaster from 7's usertile10, also taken by Donovan Reese.- White Cat is another picture by GK Hart/Vikki Hart, who took a few user account pictures used in Vista and 7.
